Taking notes during class? Topic-focused study? A consistent learning environment? All are exactly opposite of the best strategies for learning.
> 在上课期间做笔记？主题聚焦式学习？保持稳定一致的学习环境？所有这些都完全与正确的学习策略相违背。

I recently had the good fortune to interview Robert Bjork, the director of the UCLA Learning and Forgetting Lab, a distinguished professor of psychology, and a massively renowned expert on packing things in your brain in a way that keeps them from leaking out.
> 我最近有幸采访了Robert Bjork, UCLA学习与遗忘实验室的领头人，一位杰出的心理学教授，在帮助人们记住事情并防止它们从脑中溜走这个领域他也是著名专家。

It turns out that everything I thought I knew about learning is wrong.
> 结果表明好像我以往对学习的认识都是错误的。

First, he told me, think about how you attack a pile of study material.
> 首先他说，想想你是如何开始处理一堆学习资料的？

“People tend to try to learn in blocks,” Bjork said. “Mastering one thing before moving on to the next.” 
> 人们倾向于积木式学习，他说，人们倾向于熟练掌握一件事情后再转移到下一件事上。

Instead of doing that Bjork recommends interleaving. The strategy suggest that instead of spending an hour working on your tennis serve, you mix in a range of skills like backhands, volleys, overhead smashes, and footwork.
> 抛弃那种做法，Bjork推荐交错式学习。他建议，与其你花一个小时练习网球发球，不如将一系列技术混在一起练习，比如反手，网前截击，过顶高压，还有步法。

“This creates a sense of difficulty,” Bjork said. “And people tend not to notice the immediate effects of learning.”
> 这营造出一种困难的感觉，Bjork说，并且人们就会倾向于不去注意学习的即时效果。

Instead of making an appreciable leap forward with your serving ability after a session of focused practice, interleaving forces you to make nearly imperceptible steps forward with many skills. But over time, the sum of these small steps is much greater than the sum of the leaps you would have taken if you’d spent the same amount of time mastering each skill in its turn.
> 与你‘试图通过一段时间的专注练习使自己在发球技术方面有明显进步’不同的是，交错式学习强迫你同时在多个技能上产生近乎觉察不到的微小进步。

Bjork explains that successful interleaving allows you to “seat” each skill among the others. “If information is studied so that it can be interpreted in relation to other things in memory, learning is much more powerful,” he said. There’s one caveat: Make sure the mini skills you interleave are related in some higher-order way. If you’re trying to learn tennis, you’d want to interleave serves, backhands, volleys, smashes, and footwork — not serves, synchronized swimming, European capitals, and programming in Java.
> Bjork解释说，成功的交错式学习允许你暂时放下某一项技能。“如果某些知识已经被学过了，那么它就能与记忆中的其他事情联系起来解释，这样学习会更有效果。”他说 “有一点需要注意：确保你用这种方式学习的小技能可以与某些更高级的方法有关联。如果你正在尝试学习网球，你应该是要把发球，反手，网前，高压，步法这些交错起来学——而不是学发球，同时又在学游泳，European capitals, 还有编程语言java”(作者的意思应该是学习的各个小技能应该相互之间或与更高级一些的技能有所关联或能构成支持关系，比如在网球里步法是除了发球以外所有技术的基础，因为所有正确击球都要使用脚步调整到合适的击球点，但从训练角度讲，脚站在原地不动也可以完成几乎所有网球技术动作，那么我也可以站在原地先练好我身上和手上的动作，这种关系从不同的方向看过去可能是不同的，重要的是“有关联”。)

Similarly, studying in only one location is great as long as you’ll only be required to recall the information in the same location. If you want information to be accessible outside your dorm room, or office, or nook on the second floor of the library, Bjork recommends varying your study location.
> 类似的，只在同一个地点学习就好像你只被要求在同一个地点回忆信息。如果你想要在你寝室以外的地方让信息轻松被提取，或者在办公室，在实验室二楼的角落，Bjork推荐变换你的学习地点。

Interleaving and varying your study location will help whether you’re mastering math skills, learning French, or trying to become a better ballroom dancer. A somewhat related phenomenon — the spacing effect, which was first described by Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885 — will also help.
> 不管你想是掌握数学知识，法语，还是想成为一名更好的舞者，交错式学习与变换学习地点都会有帮助。一个有些相关的现象是——空间间隔效应，同样会对你有所帮助，它的第一个提出者是 Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885。

“If you study and then you wait, tests show that the longer you wait, the more you will have forgotten,” Bjork said.
> 实验表明如果你学习后等了一段时期，这段等待时期越长，你忘记的越多，Bjork说。

 But here’s the cool part: If you study, wait, and then study again, the longer the wait, the more you’ll have learned after this second study session. Bjork explains it this way: “When we access things from our memory, we do more than reveal it’s there. It’s not like a playback. What we retrieve becomes more retrievable in the future. Provided the retrieval succeeds, the more difficult and involved the retrieval, the more beneficial it is.”
> 但最精彩的部分来了：如果你先学习，然后等一段时间，接着再学一次，那么中间等的时间越长，你在第二次学习之后记住的就更多。Bjork这样解释：“当我们从记忆中提取东西时，我们做的不仅仅是将其暴露在那里，这不像是回放。我们现在二次提取的信息将会在将来变得更容易被提取。对成功地再次提取有帮助的是，在这过程中卷入更多的难度和专注度。”

Note that there’s a trick implied by “provided the retrieval succeeds.” You should space your study sessions so that the information you learned in the first session remains just barely retrievable. Then, the more you have to work to pull it from the soup of your mind, the more this second study session will reinforce your learning. If you study again too soon, it’s too easy.
> 注意“为成功地提取制造条件”的含义中有一个技巧。你应该将你学习的时间段间隔开来，这样第一次学习过程中接受到的信息会变得难以提取。接着，你花费越多的努力将这些内容从你脑海中拉取出来，你在第二次学习中被强化的内容就越多。如果你很快就再次进行学习，那么就太容易了。

Along these lines, Bjork also recommends taking notes just after class, rather than during — forcing yourself to recall a lecture’s information is more effective than simply copying it from a blackboard. You have to work for it. The more you work, the more you learn, and the more you learn, the more awesome you can become.
> 沿着这条思路，Bjork同样推荐在课后做笔记，而不是在上课期间做——强迫你自己回忆课程内容会比你在课上简单复制黑板上的内容更有效果。你不得不为此作出努力，你作出的努力越多，你学到的越多，你就会变得更优秀。

“Forget about forgetting,” said Bjork. “People tend to think that learning is building up something in your memory and that forgetting is losing the things you built. But in some respects the opposite is true.”
> “忘掉遗忘”，Bjork说，“人们倾向于认为学习就是在记忆中建立某些东西而遗忘就是失去这些你建立起来的东西。但是从某些视角审视，反过来看才是真相。”

See, once you learn something, you never actually forget it. Do you remember your childhood best friend’s phone number? No? Well, Bjork showed that if you were reminded, you would retain it much more quickly and strongly than if you were asked to memorize a fresh seven-digit number. So this old phone number is not forgotten — it lives somewhere in you — but recall can be a bit tricky. And while we count forgetting as the sworn enemy of learning, in some ways that’s wrong, too. The two live in a kind of symbiosis in which forgetting actually aids recall.
> 看见了吗，一旦你学习了什么东西，实际上你从未忘记它。你还记得你童年时最好朋友的电话号码吗？记不得？Bjork表示，相对于让你记住一个新的7位数号码，如果有人给你提示，那么你将会很快很强烈地想起来朋友的号码。所以这个旧号码从未被你忘记——它就在你脑中的什么地方——但是唤起会有点难度。当我们把遗忘当做学习的宿敌，从某些方面来看也是错误地。这两者有点像共生关系，实际上遗忘有助于回忆。

“Because humans have unlimited storage capacity, having total recall would be a mess,” said Bjork. “Imagine you remembered all the phone numbers of all the houses you had ever lived in. When someone asks you your current phone number, you would have to sort it from this long list.” Instead, we forget the old phone numbers, or at least bury them far beneath the ease of recall we gift to our current number. What you thought were sworn enemies are more like distant collaborators.
> “由于人类有极大的存储能力，同时回忆起全部信息将会变得一团糟” Bjork说，“想想一下你记得所有你住过的房子中的所有的电话号码。当有人问你你现在住的那间的号码时，你需要从这个庞大的清单中去检索这个号码。” 相反，我们淡忘了旧的号码，或者至少将它们埋在记忆深处比正在使用的号码更难以提取的地方。你所认为的宿敌更像是远程协助者。
