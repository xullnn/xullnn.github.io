I assume that you’ve already had a basic understanding of GROUP BY and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_function">aggregate functions</a> in SQL. If you know these two terms and ever used them but are fuzzy about them, I hope this post could help.</p>

        <!-- <p class="post excerpt"><p>Modern society addresses the ability of rapid learning a lot. To meet the word ‘rapid’, many learning projects emerge on market. They usually start with words like “n months”, “n weeks”, or end with “in just n weeks”, “in just n months”. And the marketing effect declines as <code>n</code> increases. People are inspired by encouraging ads, picturing a brighter future that will come soon just after a bearable period of time. After all, all these projects present you with so many successful cases, so you think you are going to endeavor to learn this, then you can be one of those successful cases. But actually, you are fooled by survivorship bias. All those successful cases are advertised widely. All the failed cases just leave quietly, because no one likes to broadcast their failure, so they just want to keep it down.</p>
